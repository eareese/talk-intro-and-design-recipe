# What is programming?

##### Poetry
   Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common but often deliberate.
   
##### Prose
   The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often ambiguous.
   
##### Programs
   The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.

# Tips for reading programs


### It takes longer to read them
Formal languages (programs) are much more dense than natural languages. Read carefully.

### Structure is important
The structure of a program is not always as simple as a top-to-bottom flow, something to keep in mind when navigating code.

### Details are extremely important
Typos, incorrect punctuation, unclosed parentheses or quotes -- tiny details can cause big problems.

### Variables
Variable assignment and types
### Control flow
`if/elif/else`, Boolean conditionals
### Iteration
Basic looping techniques
### Functions
Composing code into reusable functions
